# CodeQuest

A daily practice app for developers. 200 hand-checked challenges across 10 stages,
graded by really running your code.

Everything runs on your machine. No cloud account, no Docker, no native build step.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>. That starts two things:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **web** | Vite dev server on `:3000` |
| **api** | Node API on `:4000`, proxied at `/api` |

The app works with the API down — progress falls back to `localStorage` and
JavaScript runs in a Web Worker instead — it just tells you so rather than
failing silently. If the API is simply slower to boot than Vite, the page
retries and connects on its own.

To run it as one process instead:

```bash
npm run build
npm start          # app + API together on http://localhost:4000
```

## What is in the box

**200 challenges, 20 per stage**, in seven formats:

| Type | What you do |
| --- | --- |
| `quiz` | Pick the right answer, usually about a snippet |
| `output_prediction` | Say exactly what a program prints |
| `multi_select` | Pick every answer that applies |
| `fill_blank` | Type or choose the missing tokens, inline in the code |
| `pseudocode_order` | Drag scrambled pseudocode into the one correct order |
| `code_runner` | Write a function; it is graded by real test runs |
| `debug` | Find and fix a planted bug |

The path runs Programming Basics → Python → Data Structures → Algorithms → Web →
Backend → SQL → Git and Testing → System Design → Shipping.

**Three real execution engines, and no faking.**

- JavaScript runs in a sandboxed Node child process (`node:vm`, no `require`,
  no `fs`, hard-killed after 8s). If the API is down it runs in a Web Worker,
  which the main thread can terminate — the only way to stop an infinite loop.
- Python is CPython compiled to WebAssembly (Pyodide), downloaded once per session.
- C, C++, Java and Go run only if you configure a Judge0 endpoint. Without one the
  app says there is no runtime rather than pretending to compile.

**Accounts and progress.** bcrypt password hashing, JWT sessions, XP, levels,
day-based streaks and a leaderboard, stored in `server/data/db.json` (atomic
writes, so a crash mid-save cannot truncate it). Play as a guest and your local
progress is merged into the account when you sign in.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | API + web together |
| `npm run dev:api` | API only (restarts when content changes) |
| `npm run dev:web` | Web only |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Serve the built app **and** the API from one process on `:4000` |
| `npm run check` | Index, type-check, validate and lint all content |
| `npm run content:validate` | Correctness check: structure + really run every solution |
| `npm run content:lint` | Quality check: leaked hints, duplicate options, answer bias |
| `npm run content:index` | Regenerate `src/data/index.ts` after adding a batch |

## Adding challenges

Challenges live in `src/data/challenges/<stage-slug>-<batch>.ts`, each exporting
`challenges: Challenge[]`. `docs/CONTENT_AUTHORING.md` has the rules and
`src/data/challenges/programming-basics-a.ts` shows every type.

After adding a file:

```bash
npm run check
```

`scripts/validate-content.mjs` is not a schema check. It compiles the content,
verifies structure per type, rejects duplicate ids, and for every executable
challenge it **runs the reference solution against every test case** — and
separately checks that a `debug` challenge's starter code actually fails. A
challenge that cannot be solved as written will not pass.

JavaScript runs in a Node VM. Python runs through a local CPython 3 if one is on
PATH (`python3`, `python` or `py`); if there is none the run says so explicitly
rather than quietly reporting those challenges as verified.

## Layout

```
server/            Express API — auth, progress, grading, execution
  db.js            atomic JSON store
  content.js       compiles src/data with esbuild, caches to JSON
  runner/          the sandboxed child process that runs submissions
src/
  data/            stage metadata + 20 challenge batches (index.ts is generated)
  lib/             grading, level curve, highlighter, storage, sandbox worker
  services/        execution and content loading
  components/      UI, with one component per challenge type
scripts/           content validator and index generator
```

`src/lib/grading.ts` and `src/lib/leveling.ts` are compiled and imported by the
server too, so "correct" and "level 4" mean the same thing on both sides.

## Configuration

None required. `.env.example` lists the optional knobs (API port, JWT secret,
Judge0 credentials).

The `supabase/` directory is left over from an earlier hosted design and is not
wired up — the local API replaced it.
