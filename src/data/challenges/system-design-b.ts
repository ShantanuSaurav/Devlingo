    explanation:
      'The breaker exists to stop a caller from queueing work against a dependency that is already down: while OPEN it fails fast instead of burning a timeout per request. The counter must track consecutive failures, so a single success resets it, and the half-open trial is the cheap probe that decides whether the dependency has recovered without letting the full load back in at once.',
